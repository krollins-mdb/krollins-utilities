To make the |api| easily browsable, it\n   includes the links in the response body rather than in the response\n   headers.\n\n.. _api-lists:\n\nLists\n-----\n\nSome resources return a list of entities.\n\n.. example::\n\n   You can request a list of all **hosts** in a **project**.\n\nWhen a list of entities is expected in a response, the results are\nreturned in batches bounded by two query parameters:\n\n.. list-table::\n  :widths: 20 80\n  :header-rows: 1\n\n  * - Field\n    - Definition\n\n  * - ``pageNum``\n    - Page number (1-based). Defaults to 1 if not specified.\n\n  * - ``itemsPerPage``\n    - Number of items to return per page, up to a maximum of 500.\n      Defaults to 100 if not specified.\n\nThe response entity contains three fields:\n\n.. list-table::\n  :widths: 20 80\n  :header-rows: 1\n\n  * - Field\n    - Definition\n\n  * - ``totalCount``\n    - Total number of items in the entire result set.\n\n      For example, if a project has a total of 57 hosts, and you make a request\n      with ``pageNum=6`` and ``itemsPerPage=10``, then\n      ``totalCount`` is **57**.\n\n  * - ``results``\n    - Result set, which is an array of entity documents.\n\n  * - ``links``\n    - Contains one to three link relations:\n\n      - ``previous`` for the previous page of results\n        (omitted for the first page);\n      - ``next`` for the next page of results\n        (omitted for the last page);\n      - ``self`` for the current page (always present).\n\nIf you make a request for a list of entities and there are no results,\nthen the |api| responds with an |http| 200 status code and an empty\n``results`` array. It does *not* respond with a 404 in this case,\nsince the list of entities may not be empty at some point in the\nfuture.\n\nIf you had requested a list of entities in a context that does not\nexist (i.e., the list of hosts for a non-existent project), then this\nresults in a an |http| 404 response status.\n\n.. example::\n\n   This is an |http| response for the second page of 10 hosts in a\n   project with a total of 57 hosts:\n\n",

In that case, you can request that the response\ninclude an ``envelope``, which is simply an extra layer of information\nin the |json| document that contains any relevant details that would\nnormally be in the response headers.\n\nBy default, the |api| does *not* include the response in an envelope.\nTo request one, simply add the query parameter ``envelope=true``.\n\nFor responses that contain a single entity, the envelope contains two\nfields:\n\n.. list-table::\n  :widths: 20 80\n  :header-rows: 1\n\n  * - Field\n    - Definition\n\n  * - ``status``\n    - |http| status code.\n\n  * - ``content``\n    - Requested entity.\n\nFor responses that contain a list of entities, there is already an\nenvelope that wraps the results, so specifying ``envelope=true`` as a\nquery parameter in this case only adds the ``status`` field to the\nexisting envelope.\n\nPretty Printing\n---------------\n\nBy default, extraneous whitespace is stripped from the |json| that\n|mms| returns. To ask for pretty-printed |json|, simply append the\n``pretty=true`` query parameter to any request:\n\n",

This ensures that the keys and access tokens \nthat serve as usernames and passwords are never sent over the network.\nFor usage details, see :ref:`mms-prog-api-key`.\n\n.. list-table::\n   :header-rows: 1\n   :widths: 50 50\n\n   * - API Keys\n     - Service Account\n\n   * - Legacy method of authenticating to |mms| that uses \n       `HTTP digest authentication <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digest_access_authentication>`__. \n     - New method of authenticating to |mms| using the \n       industry standard `OAuth 2.0 <https://oauth.net/2/>`__ protocol with the `Client Credentials flow <https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/client-credentials/>`__. \n       *Currently in Preview*. \n\n   * - |api| keys have two parts: a Public Key and a Private Key. These \n       two parts serve the same function as a username and a password when you \n       :ref:`make API requests <example-cm-api-request>` to |mms|. \n     - A service account lets you manage permissions and create access tokens. A      \n       service account has a client ID and a secret that function as a username \n       and a password for creating access tokens. An access token lets  you \n       :ref:`make API requests <example-cm-api-request>` to |mms|.\n\n   * - |mms| hashes the Public Key and Private Key using a unique value called \n       a **nonce**.  \n       The nonce is only valid for a short amount of time as per the \n       |http| digest specification. This is to prevent replay \n       attacks, so you can't cache a nonce and use it forever.\n     - After you create a service account, you'll use its client ID and secret to \n       generate an access token, which authenticates your |api| requests.\n       Access tokens are only valid for 1 hour (3600 seconds) per the \n       OAuth 2.0 specification. Expiration of access tokens prevents \n       replay attacks, where a leaked access token could be used without a time restriction.\n\n   * - |mms| :ref:`roles <user-roles>` limit which operations |api| keys can perform. \n       You must grant roles to \n       |api| keys as you would for users to ensure the |api| keys can call |api| \n       endpoints without errors.\n     - |mms| :ref:`roles <user-roles>` limit which operations a service account \n       can perform with its access token. You must grant roles to service accounts \n       as you would for users to ensure the access token can call |api| endpoints \n       without errors. \n\n   * - |mms| binds many resources to a project. Many |api| resource\n       |url|\\s follow the format of ``/api/public/v1.0/groups/<PROJECT-ID>/``.\n       For these resources, the |api| keys must be a member of the\n       organization that hosts the project. Otherwise, |mms|\n       responds with a `401 <https://httpstatuses.com/401>`__ error.\n     - |mms| binds many resources to a project. Many |api| resource\n       |url|\\s follow the format of ``/api/public/v1.0/groups/<PROJECT-ID>/``.\n       For these resources, the service account must be a member of the\n       organization that hosts the project. Otherwise, |mms|\n       responds with a `401 <https://httpstatuses.com/401>`__ error.\n\n   * - Each |api| key belongs to only one organization, but you can grant \n       |api| keys access to any number of projects in that \n       organization.\n     - Each service account belongs to only one organization, but you can grant \n       a service account access to any number of projects in that organization.\n\nSome resource methods require even more security and are additionally\nprotected by :ref:`access lists <access-list-for-api-operations>`\nthat allow access to the resource only from the |ipaddr| addresses\nlisted. Each user configures their own access list of |ipaddr|\naddresses that allow access to the resource.\n\n.. _api-automation:\n\nAutomation\n----------\n\nThe :doc:`/reference/api/automation-config` and\n:doc:`/reference/api/automation-status` resources provide endpoints\nthat let you modify a project's deployment and retrieve deployment\nstatus. You can modify a deployment by sending a new\n:doc:`automation configuration </reference/cluster-configuration>` to\n|mms|. The automation configuration is where you describe and\nconfigure the MongoDB processes to be deployed. |mms| refers to this\nas the deployment's \"goal state.\" When you submit a new automation\nconfiguration through the |api|, the {+aagent+}s adjust the\ncurrent state of the system to match the goal state.\n\n.. important::\n\n   There is no protection in the |api| to prevent concurrent\n   modifications. If two administrators both start with a\n   configuration based on the current version, make their own\n   modifications, and then submit their modifications, the later\n   modification wins.\n\n.. _api-rate-limiting:\n\nRate Limiting\n-------------\n\nCertain resources are subject to rate limiting.\n\nFor resources that are rate limited, |mms| allows up to 100\nrequests per minute *per project*. Keep in mind that a Public |api|\nKey is assigned to a |mms| user, but that user may access multiple\nprojects.\n\n.. example::\n\n   Consider two users: A and B.\n\n   User A belongs to project X, and user B belongs to projects X\n   and Y.\n\n   1. At 1:00:00pm, User A makes 50 requests to a rate limited\n      resource in project X, all of which complete by 1:00:20pm.\n   #. At 1:00:30pm, User B attempts to make 60 requests to a rate\n      limited resource in project X.\n\n      Since User A has already used up 50 requests within the\n      1:00pm minute for project X, the last 10 requests User B\n      attempts to make are rejected. However, User B can make\n      requests to a rate limited resource in project Y, since each\n      project maintains a separate request counter.\n\n   #. At 1:01pm, requests to project X may proceed, because the\n      request counter used for rate limiting reset each minute.\n\nIf you exceed the rate limit, the |api| returns an |http|\n``429 Too Many Requests`` response code.\n\nAdditional Information\n----------------------\n\nSee :doc:`/reference/api` for a complete reference\nof all resources available in the |mms| Public |api|.\n\n",

For example, to set\n       **processes.lastCompact**\n       to 28 January 2021 at  2:43:52 PM US Central Standard Time, use\n       ``\"processes.lastCompact\" : \"2021-01-28T14:43:52-06:00\"``\n\n   * - processes[n].lastRestart\n     - string\n     - Optional\n     - |iso8601-time| when |mms| last restarted this process. If you\n       set this parameter to the current timestamp, |mms| forces a\n       restart of this process after you upload this configuration.\n       If you set this parameter for multiple processes in the same\n       cluster, the |mms| restarts the selected processes in a rolling\n       fashion across members of the replica set or shards.\n\n   * - processes[n].lastResync\n     - string\n     - Optional\n     - |iso8601-time| of the last\n       :manual:`initial sync </core/replica-set-sync/#replica-set-initial-sync>`\n       process that |mms| performed on the node.\n       \n       To trigger the init sync process on the node immediately, set\n       this value to the current time as an |iso8601| timestamp.\n\n       :red:`WARNING:` Use this parameter with caution. During\n       :manual:`initial sync </core/replica-set-sync/#replica-set-initial-sync>`, Automation removes the entire\n       contents of the node's ``dbPath`` directory.\n\n       If you set this parameter:\n\n       - On the secondary node, the {+mdbagent+} checks whether the\n         specified timestamp is later than the time of the last resync,\n         and if confirmed, starts init sync on this node.\n         \n         For example, to set ``processes.lastResync`` on the secondary node to 28\n         May 2021 at 2:43:52 PM US CentralStandard Time, use:\n\n         ``\"processes.lastResync\" : \"2021-05-28T14:43:52-06:00\"``\n            \n         If the {+mdbagent+} confirms that this timestamp is later\n         than the recorded time of the last resync, it starts init\n         sync on the node.\n\n       - On the primary node, the {+mdbagent+} waits until you ask the\n         primary node to become the secondary with the\n         :method:`rs.stepDown` method, and then starts init sync on\n         this node.\n\n       - On all of the nodes in the same cluster, including the\n         primary, the {+mdbagent+} checks whether the specified\n         timestamp is later than the time of the last resync, and if\n         confirmed, starts init sync on the secondary nodes in a\n         rolling fashion. The {+mdbagent+} waits until you ask the\n         primary node to become the secondary with the\n         :method:`rs.stepDown` method, and then starts init sync on\n         this node.\n\n       To learn more, see :manual:`Initial Sync </core/replica-set-sync/#replica-set-initial-sync>`.\n\n   * - processes[n].lastKmipMasterKeyRotation\n     - string\n     - Optional\n     - |iso8601-time| when |mms| last rotated the master |kmip| key. If\n       you set this parameter to the current timestamp, |mms| rotate the key after you upload this configuration.\n\n   * - processes[n].logRotate\n     - object\n     - Optional\n     - MongoDB configuration object for rotating the MongoDB logs of a\n       process.\n\n   * - processes[n].logRotate.\n       numTotal\n     - integer\n     - Optional\n     - Total number of log files that |mms| retains. If you don't set\n       this value, the total number of log files defaults to **0**.\n       |mms| bases rotation on your other **processes.logRotate**\n       settings.\n\n   * - processes[n].logRotate.\n       numUncompressed\n     - integer\n     - Optional\n     - Maximum number of total log files to leave uncompressed,\n       including the current log file. The default is **5**.\n\n   * - processes[n].logRotate.\n       percentOfDiskspace\n     - number\n     - Optional\n     - Maximum percentage of total disk space that |mms| can use to\n       store the log files expressed as decimal. If this limit is\n       exceeded, |mms| deletes compressed log files until it meets this\n       limit. |mms| deletes the oldest log files first.\n\n       The default is **0.02**.\n\n   * - processes[n].logRotate.\n       sizeThresholdMB\n     - number\n     - Required\n     - Maximum size in MB for an individual log file before |mms|\n       rotates it. |mms| rotates the log file immediately if it meets\n       the value given in either this **sizeThresholdMB** or the\n       **processes.logRotate.timeThresholdHrs** limit.\n\n   * - processes[n].logRotate.\n       timeThresholdHrs\n     - integer\n     - Required\n     - Maximum duration in hours for an individual log file before the\n       next rotation. The time is since the last rotation.\n\n       |mms| rotates the log file once the file meets either this\n       **timeThresholdHrs** or the\n       **processes.logRotate.sizeThresholdMB** limit.\n\n   * - processes[n].manualMode\n     - Boolean\n     - Optional\n     - Flag that indicates if {+mdbagent+} automates this process.\n\n       - This defaults to **false**.\n       - Set to **true** to disable Automation on this process.

If your arrays are unbounded or exceedingly large, those \narrays may degrade read and write performance.\n\nIf you create an index on an array, each element in the array is \nindexed. If you write to that array frequently, the performance cost of \nindexing or re-indexing a potentially large array field may be \nsignificant.\n\n.. seealso::\n   \n   :ref:`unbounded-arrays-anti-pattern`\n\n.. _anti-pattern-denormalization:\n\nDenormalization\n---------------\n\nDenormalizing your schema is the process of duplicating fields or \nderiving new fields from existing ones. Denormalization can improve \nread performance in a variety of cases, such as:\n\n- A recurring query requires a few fields from a large document in \n  another collection. You may choose to maintain a copy of those fields \n  in an embedded document in the collection that the recurring query \n  targets to avoid merging two distinct collections or performing \n  frequent ``$lookup`` operations.\n\n- An average value of some field in a collection is frequently \n  requested. You may choose to create a derived field in a separate \n  collection that is updated as part of your writes and maintains a \n  running average for that field.\n\nWhile embedding documents or arrays without duplication is \npreferred for grouping related data, denormalization can improve read \nperformance when separate collections must be maintained.\n\n.. note::\n   \n   When you denormalize your schema, it becomes your responsibility to \n   maintain consistent duplicated data.\n\nLearn More\n----------\n\nThe best structure for your schema depends on your application context. \nThe following resources provide detailed information on data modeling \nand additional example use cases for embedded documents and arrays:\n\nData Models\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- To learn more about Data Modeling in MongoDB and the flexible schema\n  model, see :manual:`Data Modeling Introduction\n  </core/data-modeling-introduction/>`.\n\n- To learn more about the tradeoffs between embedded and normalized\n  data models, see\n  :manual:`Data Model Design </core/data-model-design/>`.\n\n- MongoDB also offers a free MongoDB University Course on Data Modeling:\n  `Data Modeling for MongoDB <https://learn.mongodb.com/learning-paths/data-modeling-for-mongodb>`__.\n\nMongoDB.live 2020 Data Modeling Presentations\n`````````````````````````````````````````````\n\n.. include:: /includes/fact-mongodb-live-2020-data-model-methodology.rst\n\nArrays\n~~~~~~\n\nTo learn more about how to query arrays in MongoDB, see\n:manual:`Query an Array </tutorial/query-arrays/>`.\n\nDesign Patterns\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n.. include:: /includes/fact-array-design-patterns.rst\n\nDenormalized Schemas\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n.. include:: /includes/fact-denormalization-design-patterns.rst\n\n",
