Omitting the --compact option for a json output returns array objects within a 'results' sub-array. You must specify --output json to use this option.\n   * - -h, --help\n     - \n     - false\n     - help for list\n   * - --limit\n     - int\n     - false\n     - Number of items per results page, up to a maximum of 500. If you have more than 500 results, specify the --page option to change the results page. This value defaults to 100.\n   * - --omitCount\n     - \n     - false\n     - Flag that indicates whether the JSON response returns the total number of items (totalCount) in the JSON response.\n   * - --orgId\n     - string\n     - false\n     - Organization ID to use. This option overrides the settings in the configuration file or environment variable.\n   * - -o, --output\n     - string\n     - false\n     - Output format. Valid values are json, json-path, go-template, or go-template-file.
